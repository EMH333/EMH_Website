                <p>My name is Ethan Hampton and I am a self employed technology consultant. I work to improve individuals usage
                    of technology and insure they are getting the most out of technology as possible. My goal is to be as
                    helpful as possible.</p>
                <h2>A little about me!</h2>
                <p>If I am not working with technology, I enjoy reading, writing on my website, biking, running, tinkering,
                    hanging with friends and relaxing. I have a lot of involvement with the clubs at my high school, especially
                    robotics. I love my family who also has websites, where you can find my sister
                    <a href="http://sophiahampton.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and my father
                    <a href="http://www.procareering.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Also, I enjoy programming robots as well as small web toys and other projects. If you would
                    like to know more about Ethan Hampton, you should check out my
                    <a href="https://www.ethohampton.com/about-me/">about me page</a>! The blog section of my website (which you can find
                    <a href="https://www.ethohampton.com/blog/">here</a>) has my musings and thoughts on a variety of topics as well as updates on my life. These posts
                    are generally about topics that matter to me, ranging from respect to my love life to
                    <a href="https://www.ethohampton.com/2018/04/benefits-wikipedia/">the benefits of Wikipedia</a>. It would mean a lot if you took the time to check it out! My life as Ethan
                    is pretty crazy, and I find writing to be pretty soothing. My goal is to write at least one article a
                    month. I sometimes publish some essays and other stories from school if I think they meet my quality
                    requirements. Basically, if I wrote it before high school, there is very little chance that it will appear
                    here. I may expose information about a person that is not public. If I do, I will do my best to get their
                    approval before posting even if they would remain anonymous. If you have any questions about anything
                    I do, please feel free to contact me at:
                    <a href="mailto:etho@ethohampton.com">etho@ethohampton.com</a> I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
