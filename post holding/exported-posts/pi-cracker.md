I figured I would do a little blog post about what I have been working
on recently.
Several weeks ago I discussed with some of my friends about a way to in
to crack passwords using Pi as the input string. I announce to you... Pi
Cracker! It currently is in development, so you can find it on GitHub
and is written in Java. You can find it here
([www.github.com/EMH333/Pi-cracker](http://www.github.com/EMH333/Pi-cracker)).
It currently has the bug of not being able to crack any password other
than plain text and 4 characters but I am working harder to get this
fixed. I will be doing a video about how this works so expect it soon.

In theory, because Pi follows the golden ratio it should crack faster
than brute force although this is not proven. In the future, it would
make sense to have the character set be adjustable. There is a lot of
work that could be done to improve it but I don't really have the time.
For now you can see this picture below that demonstrates it cracking the
weak password of "ddbb"

### How Can I get Involved in Pi Cracker?

It actually is really simple to get involved, all you need to do is go
to the GitHub page and if you want to add a feature or fix a bug then
click the fork button to add this project to your account then merge the
changes you make back into the main branch. You should check out this
page (<http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html>) for more
information. So, if you have any questions about the project please feel
free to comment down below and I will happily respond.

Let me know if you have any other questions and continue what you
normally do, just read my stuff. Thanks!
