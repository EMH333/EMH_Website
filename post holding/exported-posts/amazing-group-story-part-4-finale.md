This is part three of four of a 27 page group story that was written
during 9th grade language arts. This story is one of heroics and love
and pain and sorrow. Without further adieu, **The Amazing Group story!**

**Please note this is unedited directly from the Google Docs other than
the pictures Ethan adds. Also please be aware that this story may not be
(take that as “is not”) appropriate for younger audiences. Look who
wrote this story at the bottom, it was definitely a group effort!**

[Emily’s eyes shot open, her gaze found a metal ring rotating above her
almost like a cat scan but with more pieces missing. Keegan stood up
from a one similar to her’s stretching
enthusiastically.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“So, ready to take a walk?” asked Keegan impatiently, he knew that Abe
was growing tired and he wanted to perform the ritual while the sun was
still up. Matt stood up from behind a small rock which he had been
resting against whilst waiting for them to wake
up.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“The ladder is set up bro,” Matt said as he turned to face Keegan.
Keegan, now fully awake, turned to Abe who had been monitoring Keegan
and Emily’s HEARTHELMETS from a separate panel. Abe turned to see a
distinctive nod from Keegan which notioned him it was time to leave,
well that is if he didn’t want to be late to the opera house. Emily was
still left a little confused at this point but then decided that it was
probably all good. “To the Bridge” Matt said as he grasped Emily’s
shoulder firmly so she could not escape. After hearing this Keegan
grinned and turned towards the ladder perched on a small rock outcrop,
under it lay a hot pool of lava.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“So uh this is exciting, I’m gonna head over to the food car, if they
even have those on subway trains” Tristan said as he stood up from his
seat.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[The hike to the Bridge wasn't as long Emily had anticipated but still
made her legs sore. Matt had released his grip after slipping and
deciding it would be better for the both of them if he just used both of
his hands to keep balance. Emily was surprised though at the size of the
bridge, like it was kinda in that middle point where it looked a little
to small to fill the gap yet by switching perspective it changed to seem
as if it were too big to fit the gap.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“So what do we do now?” asked Emily]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well, I’m gonna take that rifle on the edge there to do a trick shot
and end all of humanity, for the good of humanity, I think” Matt
responded. Emily looked at him curiously.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“You seem really indecisive about this, are you really really really
sure you want to?”asked Emily quizzically.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“I don’t know, I didn’t have a lot of time to continue to contemplate
it between my last segment and now. you should have stayed in the
machine, it would have given the write more time to build my defining
plot point” Matt responded in a calm tone.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Sorry?” Emily said confuzzled.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well I guess it’s time” Matt said as he gazed at Keegan through the
scope. He lowered the rifle and squinted at Keegan. Keegan’s enthusiasm
gave Matt an uneasy feeling but he ignored it. He stepped up onto the
railing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Okay jump, spin, switch to my
other weapon and back, then shoot, it’s simple, you can do this Matt,
then it will unleash a power wave destroying everything but
us.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Matt’s breathing slowed as he
concentrated.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“You can do it Matt!” said Emily. At this point she was still kinda out
of it and didn’t exactly know what was happening so be responsible and
don’t blame her for her actions.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“On Three! No less, No more. One, Two, Thr--” Emily was interrupted by
a large wormhole opening right beside them.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[The Subway bolted out of the portal and almost immediately into another
20ft from the first. In an epic moment of slow-motion and utter
awesomeness the protagonist jumped from one of the quickly appearing and
disappearing train cars. Yet as the jumped in slow motion Tristan turned
his head back and looked into the open door where Anna
stood.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Tristaann! I will always love you!” she cried desperately as he fell
heroically.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Yeah you too, person, stay safe, be responsible, treat others how you
want to be treated”]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[Tristan yelled back as he prepared to land. In a really classic cool
way all the character landed in a V-formation all in
unison.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Matt don’t” Riley said. although this wasn't very necessary as upon
creation of the portal Matt had stopped to watch the epicness
infold.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“But I need to do something that has meaning! For my son!” he replied
tears welling in his eyes. Matthew stepped forward and grasped Matt by
the shoulders.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Don’t worry my man, our son grew up to be awesome” said Matthew
reassuringly.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“You mean he’s alive?! My boy is Alive?!” Matt yelled excitedly in
response.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well hold your horses, there may have been some complications along
the way that I did not account for”]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Wait, he’s dead?! The moment I hear my son is Alive is the moment I
hear he is dead?!” Matt said as his whole world seemed to collapse
inside itself. Matt fell to his knees dropping the rifle and beginning
to cry.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Should I catch it before it hits
the ground? Nah, writer needs to make something interesting happen
thought]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Riley as he gazed upon the falling
firearm. Riley watched as the gun hit the ground and bounced right back
into the air spinning in a 720 only to hit the Bridge rail and go off,
firing a shot.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Gahhhhhhh….” screeched Keegan as he fell from the
ladder.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well that was convenient, at least he won’t go all humanity bomb on
us” said Emily as she gazed across the gap to the free standing
ladder.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Yeah at least that's over” Matt said
confidently.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well actually it says here in the story that due to a need of
entertainment that bullet will have not killed him yet only morphed him
into a super Keegan,” said Tristan as he closed the
book.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well that sucks” said Doc from behind
them.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Oh, forgot you were a character” said the
writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well this sucks” said Riley as he turned to see Keegan levitating
above them. His clothes had now changed from his regular Timbers jacket
and athletic shorts to a dark green duster, with a flaming black vest
underneath it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“You know, I would of thought after this long I would have a name for
my new form, like maybe]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Desert
Sun]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, get it, because I’m kinda dressed
like a cowboy and I’m on fire or maybe even
-”]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Nope,” Matt interrupted as he grabbed Matthew and formed into one
Super MATThew. MATThew then threw a fireball at Super Keegan and killed
him as his fireball was obviously heated by the most fire mixtape of all
eternity.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well that was pretty satisfying,” MATThew
said]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“So now what?”]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“I got this,  Oh Leo!” Emily called and not a moment later Leo appeared
with an open portal back home .]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“Well that’s really convenient,” Riley said]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[“And guys, I think that this has all taught us a valuable lesson, that
teamwork is very important, yeah! Okay let’s go home” Riley said as he
switched from happy and enthusiastic to tired and wanting a nap Riley.
So they all headed back through the plot portal and continued on with
their lives, except for Joe/Doc, he died two days later of AIDS. And
they all lived relatively  happy working and getting paid minimum wage
at jobs that were kinda okay, the End.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
