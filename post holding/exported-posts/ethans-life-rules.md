![Code of Conduct (My
Rules)](https://www.ethohampton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Code_of_Conduct-1024x186.png){.aligncenter
.wp-image-461 .size-large width="750" height="136"}These are a list of
all the rules I (Ethan) think it is important to live by. You don't have
to follow them all the time but for 99% of situations they definitely
apply. Please note that the first rule is definitely the most important.
Enjoy!

If you don't know me or why you should care, look
[here](https://www.ethohampton.com/about-me/). For more about Ethan
Hampton, visit [here](https://www.ethohampton.com/about-me/). I think
that rules or guidelines are critical to the success of anything because
it creates policies. The world is full of broken guidelines and policies
and rules, that's why I am planing to update this page when I come up
with new ones. The ordering is kind of important as previously mentioned
but other than the first rule, I am not thinking too much about it (this
might change).

I am also trying to link to articles I think reflect my philosophy and
meaning when I add a rule. I am also trying to keep a consistent history
of the changes I make in order to keep everything well organized.
