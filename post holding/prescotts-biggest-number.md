Prescott is a great friend of mine who is the smartest guy I know. He came up with Prescott's Biggest Number. The biggest number you will ever need.  

Lets start "small"....
----------------------

The number is as follows "The number of possible configurations of an 11 dimensional Rubik's cube with side lengths(of the Rubik's cube) of one googol in every direction" That is pretty big! Lets think about this, a normal 4D Rubik's Cube has **1,756,772,880,709,135,843,168 526 079,081,025,059,614,484,630,149,557,651,477,156,021,733,236,798,970,168,550,600,274,887,650,082,354,207,129,600,000,000,000,000** (see [http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm](http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm)) possible combinations! That is more than the number of atoms in the universe! So that may be big enough for some people's needs... The picture below is the representation of a 4D Rubik's Cube[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/84/4-cube_solved.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/84/4-cube_solved.png) Now lets look at a normal 7D Rubik's Cube with 3.37 x 108935 ([http://astr73.narod.ru/MC7D/MC7D.html](http://astr73.narod.ru/MC7D/MC7D.html)) possible combinations! That is **843000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 **(0.843X10^8855) times the number of atoms in the universe! Thinking about this a little more I realize that if I had a 7D Rubik's Cube in real life then I could store about 2338407245616.736 exabytes of information! To put that in perspective even more, I could take 7,439,542,699,743.2 days of 4k 30fps video and put that on the 7D Rubik's Cube. People, I think I solved the worlds data storage problem. Another example, 5,095,577,191.604931 years of 4k video at 120fps!  

So What is Prescott's Biggest Number?
