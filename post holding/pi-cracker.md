I figured I would do a little blog post about what I have been working on recently. Several weeks ago I discussed with some of my friends about a way to in to crack passwords using Pi as the input string. I announce to you... Pi Cracker! It currently is in development, so you can find it on GitHub and is written in Java. You can find it here ([www.github.com/EMH333/Pi-cracker](http://www.github.com/EMH333/Pi-cracker)). It currently has the bug of not being able to crack any password other than plain text and 4 characters but I am working harder to get this fixed. I will be doing a video about how this works so expect it soon. In theory, because Pi follows the golden ratio it should crack faster than brute force although this is not proven. In the future, it would make sense to have the character set be adjustable. There is a lot of work that could be done to improve it but I don't really have the time. For now you can see this picture below that demonstrates it cracking the weak password of "ddbb" [![(Image showing pi cracker break the password "ddbb"](http://www.ethohampton.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pi_Cracker_dev_1.png)](http://www.ethohampton.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pi_Cracker_dev_1.png)

### How Can I get Involved in Pi Cracker?

It actually is really simple to get involved, all you need to do is go to the GitHub page and if you want to add a feature or fix a bug then click the fork button to add this project to your account then merge the changes you make back into the main branch. You should check out this page ([http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html)) for more information. So, if you have any questions about the project please feel free to comment down below and I will happily respond. Let me know if you have any other questions and continue what you normally do, just read my stuff. Thanks!
