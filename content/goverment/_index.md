This is the main page for all of my activity as a Representative for the Associated Students of Oregon State University House of Representatives in the 13th ASOSU Congress. I strive to improve life for all Oregon State students, and encourage active participation in the legislative process. 

## Office Hours

Fall term 2021, my office hours are Wednesdays from 2-3 in SEC 250. If you would like to meet remotely, that can also be accommodated. Please contact me via my ASOSU email at [asosu.representative12@oregonstate.edu](mailto:asosu.representative12@oregonstate.edu)

## Legislative Priorities

- Equitable access to student resources
- Safe learning environment - focusing specifically on COVID-19
- The Climate Crisis
- Other issues YOU want me to represent (again, I encourage you to come to my office hours!)
