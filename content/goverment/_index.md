This is the main page for all of my activity as the Vice-Chair of the Associated Students of Oregon State University (ASOSU) Judicial Council. I strive to improve life for all Oregon State students, and encourage active participation in the student government process.

I previously served as a Representative in the House of Representatives for the 2021-2022 school year. During that time, I served on the Elections Committee as Vice-Chair of Data and Statistics. The 13th Congress was able to pass several items of legislation that increased equity and quality of life for Oregon State University students. I'm happy to talk about the work that I did during my time in the house, please reach out!

## Office Hours

I'm occasionally in the ASOSU office (SEC 250) in the Student Experience Center although I don't really have any set schedule. Please let me know if you would like me to met in the office (or remotely) and I'm happy to do so. Please feel free to email me via my OSU email at [asosu.jcvicechair@oregonstate.edu](mailto:asosu.jcvicechair@oregonstate.edu).
