This is all the fee bills that were voted on while I was a representative during joint sessions. The only bill I voted against was the ASOSU bill because [of the issues I wrote about earlier]({{< ref "goverment/asosu-dp4-fy2023/index.md" >}}). The motion I made to extend discussion failed and as such, I felt it was appropriate to express my lack of approval with the budget as it stood.
