# Ethan Hampton's Projects

This page lists various projects that are currently public to the world (at various stages of completion).

## [esbuild-svelte](https://github.com/EMH333/esbuild-svelte)
This is an [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) plugin that allows the compilation of files from the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework. These are two of the most efficient front-end development tools I know and it is a clear win to be able to bring them together. Most of my front-end projects use Svelte and/or esbuild in some capacity so I use this all the time.

## [MACAB](https://abday.ethohampton.com)
My high school had alternating "A" and "B" days which had different classes. It got confusing to know what day was when, so I built a progressive web app! It can work offline and although fairly simple, served an important purpose in my life. I continue to update it when I can, so current students can still use it.

## [Race Timer](https://www.ethohampton.com/projects/timer/)
My family has a race on Thanksgiving every year to raise money for our local food bank. It was difficult finding a timer (without ads and simple to use) to suite our needs, so I built one!

## [Neat]({{< ref "well-thats-neat.md" >}})
A basic link tool that allows me to dynamically add links to the sidebar of this site that I think are neat. Super basic, but nice to have.
