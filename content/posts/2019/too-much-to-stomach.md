One of the hardest things programmers have to do is keep all the information they gather looking at code in their head at one time. Where was that function called? What was that variable set by? How does that code result in that output? Over and over again they gain knowledge to keep for a few minutes then loose it and replace it with something else. Often programmers get into a state of 'flow' where they don't notice time go by and are only focusing on the code they are working on and nothing else. 

That state of flow has happened to me a few time and it is very invigorating when it happens because you end up getting a lot done in less time. It doesn't take much to get out of it though, it could be a garbage truck going by, a co-worker unintentionally sneaking up behind you to talk making you jump out of your chair or other distractions. Then it takes more than 15-20 minutes to get back into that state of flow again because you have to relearn what you were holding in your memory during that time.
