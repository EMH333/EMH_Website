Hello!

A friend recently asked me (and I am summarizing here), "Ethan, I want to start my own blog where I can publish articles and then create a mailing list. What should I use to do that?" I thought, "Well that's a great question Phil! Let me get back to you" so I am using this blog post as a way to do that.

## My Blog

What do I use to host my blog? Well a couple of things actually, Hugo, Forestry.io, Cloudflare and a nameless hosting provider. Eventually I will move to be hosting my own website behind Azure but for now I will be sticking with my current set up.

What does all of that mean? Well lets start with Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator (SSG) that takes a theme and some content and combines them into a static website (so like I can't log in to it or leave comments or stuff). For me it has worked out great because I love being able to customize everything and I have been able to do that all the way down to making my own theme which means I essentially have full control over every single line of code that gets presented.

Second, Forestry.io, which serves as my CMS (or content management system). That is what I am typing this post on as we speak. Unless you are using a SSG you won't need them but they have been great. I ran into some trouble with the way I configured things in the beginning and they were able to escalate the issue up the chain to get it resolved in a very professional way. I think they get enough business from their "Pro" users that they can offer a lot of stuff for free, so I have been using their free plan with absolutely zero issues.

Third, Cloudflare. Probably one of my favorite companies at this point (other than Backblaze, Cosco and a few others) for a couple of reasons. Namely, they have a wonderful blog that goes into details about how they operate and give some great details about operating a scale. They also have an excellent free plan which saves on bandwidth and also makes sure that you are staying up to date with the latest in website technology (HTTP/2, HTTPS, and a few other things). Their main selling point to paying customers is DDoS protection which is really great and means if I ever need to deal with a ton of traffic, they will be able to help me scale really pretty quickly.

Finally, I have the unnamed hosting provider. They will remain unnamed because as cheap as they are, they aren't the most performance oriented and have been a fairly big pain point for me. They are definitely not the worst host I have come across but could still use some improvement. As mentioned earlier I plan to migrate to Azure in the near future because I have decided I like Microsoft again (at least ignoring most of the Windows world that is) which should actually reduce costs and increase performance. I haven't done this because I don't have the time right now as a college student.

I use Github to host the actual source code but it isn't as big of a deal and not a huge part of the process. Although it does mean you can help improve the site if you like, its source code is available for viewing in all of it's glory.

## A Quick Plug

I am in the process of starting up a consulting business. If you are interested in having me host your website, please contact me at etho@ethohampton.com! I also can do technology consultations for more general things and have experience with Java and C# as back end technologies as well as Javascript and Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) for the front end. This helps you as well as giving me experience with a wide variety of use cases and customers.
