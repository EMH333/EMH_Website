# There is one wrong, and one right way to do things
You may not even realize it. The people around you have all made the decision, it wasn't something they just thought up, it happened naturally, in their sleep, maybe with out them even realizing it. Once they made up their mind, it was super difficult to stop. It haunted them for the rest of their lives. The impact for some of them affected entire nations or even the world.

Do you live in the short term or long term? Do you think about what people are going to think in an hour, a day, a week, a month or a year? How long can you wait for a reward? I'm not going to pretend that its a clear black and white situation, obviously it is important to think long term in some situations, and short term in others, but at the same time, there are so many things that must be decided on a day to day basis, you will start to reflect one way or the other. 

I am most certainly a long term thinker, when I think about what I want to do in life, most all of my goals are quite long term. However, I don't think that long term is always the best, in situations where there isn't a clear path or way to go often short term individuals will come out on top. That doesn't mean either way is better, but there are clear reasons to view both points of view. 

At some point everyone needs to make up their mind independently. If you switch between short term and long term thinking methods too often, or too dramatically it can cause huge problems to open up in your life that could have easily been avoided if you had just picked a side.
