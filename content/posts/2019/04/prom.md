I just graduated high school a month ago to this day. It is very interesting to look at what I might regret doing or not doing in high school and whether that lines up with the rest of the world. Originally I was going to give a bunch of facts and statistics about why my way is better than anyone else's but I realized it doesn't matter. This article isn't for you, it solely exists for me.

Basically I have this idea that I am not going to regret not having used drugs or alcohol while in high school. The simple reason for this being that I have yet to meet someone who wishes they did more of those things when they were in high school. I mean think about it, if drugs and alcohol were something no one regretted, then we would see more use across time in the high school population. In 2016, the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](http://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh) reported that 19% of youth aged 12 to 20 years drink alcohol. Wouldn't that number be higher if it were a good idea? Obviously there are other factors about why that number is lower and just because no one does something never means that thing is a bad idea (in this case it happens to be a bad idea but I digress), however I think it proves a point.

If you look at /r/askReddit and see questions like "What do you regret most about high school" a vast majority of them fall in to a few categories:

* Asking someone out/pursuing a romantic interest
* Getting more involved
* Paying attention in class and studying
* Being more social

The word "alcohol" didn't appear on the page once. Neither did "drink" in the context of alcohol. I think that really says something about the choices one makes in their lives day to day. The things people regret in the long term are the things people think are fun in the short term. Additionally, the things that are hard in the short term, are super important when given the chance to look back. 

Because I classify myself as an INTJ on the MBTI matrix, this thought isn't something out of the ordinary with what others are thinking but still deserves some thought. I will probably go into greater detail about why I am so against substances at this age and will eventually be for them in moderation as I grow up at some point.  For now though, lets just assume that progression is a part of my development.
