I have come to this realization recently about certain events and habits in high school. I'm not sure if this is the final form of this idea but I came across a pretty cool conclusion recently after a math test that I wanted to share.

 Basically I have this idea that I am not going to regret not using drugs or alcohol while in high school. The simple reason for this being that I have yet to meet someone who wishes they did more of those things when they were in high school (I am counting this for people over 25, some below 25 have other opinions but I don't feel like they count for this). I mean think about it, if drugs and alcohol were something no one regretted, then we would see more use across time in the high school population. In 2016, the [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](http://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh) reported that 19% of youth aged 12 to 20 years drink alcohol and 12% reported binge drinking in the past 30 days. Wouldn't that number be higher if it were a good idea? Obviously there are other factors about why that number is lower and just because no one does something is it a bad idea (in this case it is but I digress), but I think it proves a point.

Because I classify myself as an INTJ on the MBTI matrix, this thought isn't something out of the ordinary with what others are thinking but still deserves some thought. I will probably go into greater detail about why I am so against substances at this age and will eventually be for them in moderation as I grow up at some point.  For now though, lets just assume that progression is a part of my development.

So what about prom? It is in high school and not everyone goes to it. Why is that okay to experience in high school but drugs and alcohol aren't? Ignoring the fact that drugs and alcohol are illegal for teens to consume (which is a big reason), there is one idea that convinces me. Prom is a once (or twice, or I think six plus times for my father going as a 'safe date') in a lifetime experience. Needless to say it doesn't happen again once you get out of high school. Besides not everyone goes to prom, research from [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2014/04/28/proms) in 2014 shows that 53% of Americans didn't actually attend prom, and among those that did 51% went with a date. Overall, this means that only 24% of Americans had the 'typical' experience of attending prom with a boyfriend or girlfriend (the other 49% includes going as friends).
