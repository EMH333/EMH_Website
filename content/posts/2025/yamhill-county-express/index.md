For a very long time I've wanted regular train service into McMinnville, Oregon. This is my proposal on how such regional rail service could be achieved in a financially feasible and universally beneficial way.
<!--more-->
The proposed ~26 mile route would initially travel between McMinnville and Tualatin where it would link up with the TriMet WES commuter train for connections into the broader Portland Metro Area.

Stations would include:
- McMinnville (~34k residents)
- Lafayette (~4.4k)
- Dundee (~3.2k)
- Newberg (~25k)
- Sherwood (~20k)
- Tualatin (~28k)

The total residents within the catchment area is approximately 115k with potential expansions:
- South towards Amity and Sheridan (1.7k and 6.2k residents)
- East towards Lake Oswego (40k residents)
- North towards Beaverton (97k residents) for a single transfer via the TriMet MAX Red Line to reach Portland International Airport

## Trackage and Timings

Due to the over 60 at-grade crossings (many of which don't have active signaling), speeds would often be limited to under 30 mph. If incorporating stopping time at stations, the end-to-end trip time would be approximately 1hr 20min. An average trip via car currently takes approximately 45 minutes outside of rush hour. <!--TODO firm this number up-->

The tracks to be used are currently owned by [Portland and Western Railroad](https://www.gwrr.com/pnwr/), who also is the operator of the TriMet WES commuter rail service. While track conditions remain unclear, I suspect comparatively minimal investment would be required to allow 30 mph passenger service since the tracks are used regularly for freight. 

Once service begins, improvements can be targeted and continual instead of waiting for construction to be completed across the entire line. The route is nowhere close to maxing out equipment speeds, so all improvements would have an immediate impact allowing for increased frequency as time goes on.

The initial headway target would be one and a half hours, slowly improving to under an hour after above track and operations improvements are completed. The service would run in the early morning (~5:30am) until late at night (~11pm), 7 days a week for the entire year. With some coordination with TriMet and Yamhill County Transit, this would free up buses currently assigned to the #44 route to Tigard and allow for increased investment in local transit.

## Rolling Stock

While there are several rolling stock options, Stadler's [FLIRT multiple-units](https://www.stadlerrail.com/en/solutions/rolling-stock/mainline-flirt) would be an excellent choice with a proven track record (excuse the pun) in the US. It would also be possible to purchase used vehicles, similar to TriMet WES, however the special features of the Yamhill Express (which I will detail in a moment) would be best served by newer vehicles. The choice of the FLIRT should be no surprise to most folks who are tracking rail developments in the US.

Depending on the FLIRT model selected, battery-electric operation would also be possible. Charging stations on the terminus of the route would recharge in-between runs with regenerative breaking reducing battery impact. Over time, the entire route could be progressively electrified.

These train sets also offer excellent accessibility, which would be matched with level-boarding at every station. This improves accessibility, while also decreasing the amount of time 

Generally this sort of proposal would not be seen as economically viable. However, I think this is counteracted with one typical and one atypical feature of this line.

## Features

### Transit Oriented Development

Transit Oriented Development (often shorted to TOD) is a common refrain for public transit projects. My proposal is no different. By purchasing and developing land near stations, we encourage development which is of minimal impact to the infrastructure and culture of a city, while bring in increased tax revenue and opportunity.

Yamhill County is plagued by a constricted housing supply and any new construction would serve as a relief value helping to bring down prices across the county. These developments would have mandated low-income housing elements to provide increased options to those across the economic spectrum.

### Onboard Wine Tastings

The Willamette Valley, and specifically Yamhill County, is globally renowned for excellent wines like Pinot noir. In fact, the selected route traverses through close to half of the AVAs (American Viticulture Areas) within the Willamette Valley. Wine tourism contributes significantly to the local economies along the route.

To take advantage of this, each week Friday through Sunday (depending on demand), a section of certain train runs will convert a portion of the passenger area into a wine bar for deluxe tastings during travel. These will be serviced by a rotating set of local wineries, offering the best wine Yamhill County has to offer.

Local wineries will also offer shuttle services from stations, providing a stress-free way to enjoy your visit to wine country. With dedicated on-board wine case storage, the trip home will be just as smooth!

## Pricing and Implementation Costs

### Ticket Pricing

There are three main passenger archetypes the Yamhill County Express is targeting: everyday commuters, weekend explorers, and wine tourists.

The pricing reflects this by keeping everyday travel affordable and designing elevated experiences for those who would like to take advantage.

First boarding each week: $6
Second through fifth boarding: $3
Sixth boarding onward: Free
Free glass of wine every 50 boardings.

Wine tasting experience: $50/person (includes boarding and a 3 glass flight; one fee waved with a three or more bottle purchase on-board; additional wine by the glass available)
Charcuterie board: $30

The everyday commuter pays $18 per week and would receive a free glass of wine every couple months. The weekend explorer pays $9 for a round-trip. A couple of wine tourists would pay $130 for a wine tasting + charcuterie.

Discounts of 50% are available for low-income residents or 1-station trips (Lafayette to Dundee for example).

### Implementation Costs

The costs of this service are heavily capital focused in the first year, then gradually transition to operational costs.

First-year captial requriements include:
- 2 FLIRT trainsets
- Construction of 5 stations (excluding existing in Tualatin)
- Trackage and signaling improvements to bring route to minimum passenger specs

Ongoing operational costs include:
- Track and rolling stock maintenance
- Fees to utilize P&W Railroad trackage
- Personnel costs
- Passenger space cleaning
- Wine tasting supplies (mostly supplied by wineries but may need to be supplemented)
