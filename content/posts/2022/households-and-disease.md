I go to Oregon State University, which hasn't gone remote for the recent wave of Omicron COVID-19 in Oregon. As a result, I've been exposed to a great deal of risk and have had to give some thought to how to reduce my exposure. This is a quick overview of my ideology.

It boils down to this:

> If I know that I'm healthy, and I'll be in an unmasked/unprotected environment, then I should look to minimize my exposure based more so on number of households and less so on number of people. Households should be prioritized based on size of household.

## Assumptions

- Households are all positive or all negative for the disease
- The chance an individual/household is positive increase as size of household increases
- If exposed to an individual, there is 100% chance of infection
- Ignoring all factors outside of the unprotected environment
- Tests are 100% accurate

## Theory

If an individual is perfectly healthy (and ideally can prove it) then they should have no qualms about exposing themselves to other perfectly healthy people (again, who can prove it). The number doesn't matter because (as stated above), the tests are always correct.

In an environment where the other individuals can't prove it, then more caution is needed. This is where minimization of households is more useful than minimization of people. If required to add one more person to the environment, they should always be from a household already present compared to a new household.

## Examples

Here `F|N` denotes the focus individual in a room with someone negative (though they don't know that). `F|P` means the same but the other individual is positive. `F|N2` adds one more person from the household. `F|P|N` adds an additional household.

### `F|N`

The focus individual is fine.`F|N99` still would result in the same outcome.

### `F|P`

The focus individual is infected. This is the case regardless of size of the household present. `F|P99` still would result in the same outcome.

### `F|N|P`

This is where things get interesting. Now the focus individual and the first household would be infected. The size of either household doesn't matter, the outcome would be the same.

This is where the first part of my theory comes from. Always add from an existing household if possible as it reduces risk for all those involved.

## Household Size

The larger in size a household, the greater chance it is infected. We can say this because each individual in the household will have their own network of connections which increases risk of infection.
