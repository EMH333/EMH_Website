You grow up knowing the iceberg metaphor, 10-20% is above water, 80-90% below, most people focus on the top, but the real size is what is below. You also could refer to the 80/20 rule or so many others that point to a greater thing you never will see. That message is overused and not always clear in meaning. I ran into a situation today though that I think demonstrates what it means from a personal perspective. 

Firstly, I think it is important to recognize the fact that unless it's personal, it doesn't mean a thing. Those iceberg posters at my elementary school weren't personal, so they didn't really mean anything to me. If it isn't personal, then it probably won't work. There has to be some element your audience connects with on a personal level. That might be the promised tax cut they will get from growing soybeans or the way they hit the tennis ball because they can see for their own eyes what a difference it can make. Even sending a marketing email at the right time could be considered personal, because it made someone think. If something isn't personalized, it doesn't matter how important it is, no one will care.

So why do I bring this up? Well recently I wrote probably the best piece of my life, and unless some true magic happens, the essay of sorts will never be seen by more than three or four people. Morally, that's definitely for the best but a part of me also doesn't want this to be the end of it.
