Who do you publish to social media for? Who is the audience you are trying to get your message to?

When I post on Twitter, I mostly publish to non-existent "fans of Ethan Hampton". Someone who likes the same mix of content that I do and cares about my opinion on things. On Twitter I also try to be aware of the future Ethan Hampton and his employers so I try to stay mostly pleasant. Sometimes, I'll try to spread a message but I don't have the following to do anything with it. People who do read my tweets don't remember them.

My mailing list is for people who will read what I have to say and care about how smart I am (*why hello there Ethan's ego, thanks for stopping by*). I can say things that may not be suitable for a wide audience who wouldn't read the whole thing and or care about the context. I can be weird and let my obsessions show. Even though my readers are engaged, no one has asked why I haven't send an email in the last month.

On Snapchat, I'm talking with my friends. Any content there I will target at friends who may take a few seconds to look at my story or chats then move on with their day. Chats disappear and even those that are saved are never looked at again.

Instagram is for how perfect my life is. It's the beach trips, my amazing looks (note the \*hint\* of sarcasm), the incredible time I had at a summer camp and how fantastic my friends are. Folks who care about me enough to read my captions or the message of my story can get a look at a new project I'm working on or something I find important. They will forget it before they wake up the next day.

Your "audience" doesn't care about you. They don't care how much you care about something, they don't care how hard you have worked on something, they don't care how much something changed your life.

They care about how your content makes them feel. Elections are won on feelings, products are bought on feelings, deals are struck because of feelings, people are killed because of feelings. Your content doesn't suddenly get to be special and skip in front of feelings so it can go right to logic.

One of the problems that has exacerbated the divides we face today is just how much value we place in feelings. I don't think we, as a society, used to care so much about how "facts" and "opinions" made us feel. It's become acceptable to have an opinion on a fact and have that opinion supersede any of the original truth.

Social media gives us access to millions of opinions/feelings from ordinary people. This makes us feel like we can, or sometimes even have to, share our feelings about things too. It's not like it stops in the digital world either. If you can do it online, why wouldn't you do it in the physical world as well?

We are all addicted to this freedom to share our opinion. From a personal freedoms point of view, it's awesome. Never before has it been easier to get your opinion out there and share it with the world. The impact on the human race however, in my opinion, is quite terrible. Why should we care what Justin from California or Megan from Kentucky thinks about encryption or steel tariffs? Hell, why should we care what Bryan (with a y) thinks is the best TikTok fail compilation? Why should we care what Ethan thinks about opinions?

There is no easy solution here. Any "solution" has to make it through people's feelings to convince them this is a problem in the first place and that will **never** happen.
