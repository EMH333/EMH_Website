description: The most important thing in the world is respect, why is that? As Ethan
  Hampton I have developed a list of "rules" that I believe it is important to follow.
  The following is an outline of those rules and serves as a continual log of changes
  to those rules.

These are a list of all the rules I (Ethan Hampton) think it is important to live by. You don't have
to follow them all the time but for 99% of situations they definitely
apply. Please note that the first rule is definitely the most important.
Enjoy!

I think that rules or guidelines are critical to the success of anything because
it creates policies. The world is full of broken guidelines and policies
and rules, that's why I am planing to update this page when I come up
with new ones. The ordering is kind of important as previously mentioned
but other than the first rule, I am not thinking too much about it (this
might change).

I am also trying to link to articles I think reflect my philosophy and
meaning when I add a rule. I am also trying to keep a consistent history
of the changes I make in order to keep everything well organized.

## The Rules:

### 1. **Respect everything**

* The end is only the beginning
* You only live once, so be careful
* Don't judge a book by it's cover
* \[Think\]({{< ref "diversity-of-intellectual-thought.md" >}})
* The group is more important than the individual but individuals have
  the most value

  majority of people, including the creators, follow them -Modified
