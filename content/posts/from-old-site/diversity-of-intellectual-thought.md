With the whole deal about the (now ex)Google employ who wrote about
diversity in the tech industry, I read several very interesting
articles. They covered very different view points and did not agree with
each other but one thing in particular stood out. The CNN opinion
article
(<http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/07/opinions/google-employee-manifesto-against-diversity-opinion-randazza/index.html>)
written by Marc Randazza said this,

> "I just also happen to think that the company that looks for diversity
> of intellectual thought is, in the end, going to be the company that
> has greater success."

That struck me. Diversity of intellectual thought. We don't hear that
phrase come up in our day to day life but it is actually really
important. I thought I would take a look at what makes up intellectual
thought and what it means for our day to day life.

How do we define Diversity of Intellectual Thought?
---------------------------------------------------

"Diversity of intellectual thought" is a very hard phrase to define. The
phrase includes the words, "Diversity" and "Intellectual", both have
multiple meanings. The dictionary definition of "Diversity" as defined
by Merriam-Webster is,

> "The condition of having or being composed of differing elements. The
> inclusion of different types of people (such as people of different
> races or cultures) in a group or organization"

Alright we can deal with that. How about Intellectual? "Intellectual"
defined by Merriam-Webster is,

> "of or relating to the intellect or its use"

Not very helpful. How about "Intellect"? Much better,

> "
> 1.*a*:  the power of knowing as distinguished from
> the power to feel and to will: the capacity for
> knowledge

>  1.*b*: the capacity for rational or intelligent
> thought especially when highly developed

> 2.  a person with great intellectual powers
> "


So combine the definitions that make the most sense together and you
get,"The condition of having rational or intelligent thinking, composing
of different types of viewpoints, perspectives or opinions in a group or
organization". Now that's the dictionary definition that I cobbled
together however that doesn't mean I like it.

My definition looks a little different, "The idea that a group has the
capacity to look at a situation from multiple perspectives and make
intelligent choices based off of those perspectives". I think this does
a better job of defining the phrase for me but you have to decide for
your self.

# What!?!??!?

Diversity is a subject that has a lot of barbed edges and can lead to
many problems if not handled correctly. So, I'm not going to get in to
that (perhaps another article?). Instead, I'm going to focus on why
applying intellectual diversity in our day to day lives has so much
benefit. Intellectual diversity doesn't always have to mean different
profiles of people, it could also mean simply different perspectives.
Recently, I joined the National Honor Society and our induction party's
speaker was Zack Geary, the president of our local city club (and a
great guy to know) and he talked about several things (as he mentioned
in his Instagram post).

The part I want to focus on is the oranges. Now according to [this
website](http://www.mediationtools.com/articles/smbj9605.html), this
story was originally published in the Santa Monica Business Journal in
May of 1996, however I could not find the archives online so I am
quoting directly from Meditationtools.com,

> "Once upon a time there was a mother who had two children. One day,
> the kids came to the mother fighting. There was one orange left in the
> house and they both wanted it--typical of small children. What is a
> parent to do?
>
> Some parents say that they would take the orange away and send the
> kids to their rooms for fighting. Most parents say that they would cut
> the orange in half, giving each child an equal share. Finally, the
> parents with more experience, anticipating a further argument over
> which half each child wants, would improvise. By allowing one child to
> carefully cut the orange in half, and then letting the other child
> choose the half he or she wants, parents give the incentive to the
> child who cuts the orange to be as fair as possible, since he or she
> suffers the loss if the halves are not equal. Seems fair.
>
> Luckily, this particular mother is a mediator. She takes the orange
> from the crying children and asks them why they want it. When asked,
> one child expresses the desire to make orange juice. The other is
> baking muffins and needs to shave the peel into the recipe. The
> children, with the help of their mother, compromise. By allowing one
> to make all the juice he or she wants, giving the leftover peel to the
> other only once every drop of juice has been squeezed out of it, the
> other gets the entire peel intact. Both are therefore satisfied."

The take away from this story is that there are three perspectives to
this situation, you could send the children away, split the orange
equally in half, or you could simply ask what they want and give it to
them. When Zack was telling this particular story, I immediately though
about just cutting the orange in half, it made sense. In reality though,
the answer took a little more work then that.

# The Real World

If the world were full of people who would cut the orange in half when
confronted with this problem, the children would not get what they want.
However, if we have a world full of people who would divide the orange
based on what the children wanted it for, if confronted by a situation
where there is only one orange and both children need it, they would not
be able to solve it. Obviously this is over simplification, but the
lesson still applies in real life. It is important to look from
different view points in order to solve a problem in the most effective
way possible.

You can't run a company with just one viewpoint or perspective. When
faced with a important decision, it would crumble. That is why it's
important to have multiple perspectives (also known as diversity). Those
perspectives often will conflict with each other, but overall if people
share their perspective, problems would get solved quicker.

The article at mediationtools.com went on to say,

> " In our society, we are raised to think that when there is a
> conflict, one person has to win and the other has to lose. We are not
> accustomed to working out win-win solutions. It is harder to do. It
> requires more effort. The outcome, however, is worth it. By working
> together, cooperatively and collaboratively, we can come up with
> better solutions, whether in parenting, in employment settings, in
> business transactions or even in lawsuits. "

If the person who released the Google memo had brought the 10 page
document directly to Google's heads, then the results might have been
different. It is hard to say how, but I believe by having a respectful
conversation about this we can improve the workplace.

# BE INTELLIGENT

Notice how I say, intellectual though and not simply thought. A thought
might be, "Democrats suck, I hate them". A intellectual thought, as an
arguably better way to voice opinions, might be, "I have a sever dislike
for Democrats, they believe in a larger tax gap between classes and I
disagree with that". Okay maybe that is a little overkill but you get my
point, you are going to be much more influencing and professional if you
have an argument you can actually stand by and have evidence for (I
could easily back that fact up no problem).

That is why I find people like Donald Trump so concerning. He does not
back up what he is saying with actual facts and often the facts actual
point to the opposite of what he was saying. The issue of education is a
large topic I will also save for another time but its a big problem.
Only 32.5% of Americans 25 or older hold a college degree of some sort
[1]. That seems low to me, but when doing research, only Norway has a
higher rate at 35%, that is crazy.  Now, granted a college degree does
not necessarily mean you are intelligent, I consider it a good
indicator. I am willing to bet that if we applied an intellectual
thought process to our election, the outcome would have been different
by at least a few percentage points.

I have been reading a few articles on why Donald Trump won[2], and
what he said to convince people he would be good at the job. It is very
interesting to see that most Trump supporters don't take him seriously.
Granted there are a few that take everything literally but most don't. I
think, not only are we living in a post-truth world, we are living in a
post-literal world. People don't take things literally or seriously
unless they are on "the other side" and that is a problem.

I also consider intelligence to being able to refer to things as what
they actually are. For example, recently Trump was quoted as threatening
'Fire and Fury' against North Korea if it endangers US. What the heck
does that even mean? It could mean literal fire or a missile strike or a
full on military invasion, we don't know. Now Obama and others are
guilty of symbolism but we need to take a look at how it is effecting
our democracy. I believe it is harming our grasp of what actually needs
to get fixed.

# Conclusion

Intelligence is critical, it helps determine when someone is lying and
when someone is telling the truth. Intellectual thought helps you
determine what potential solutions to problems are. Diversity allows you
to use intelligence of a individual to make a overall beneficial
situation. The world is crazy right now. There is not much we can do
about it. But we can try and make intelligent choices that ask everyone
for help. Take everything you read or hear with a grain of salt, you
never know what is actually true. Diversity is one of my core values, as
is intellectual thought. We need to look at a problems from as many
angles as possible and tackle the one that makes the most sense.

**Be Kind to one another, show respect, and expect the unexpected.**
