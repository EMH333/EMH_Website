I have decided that I don't want to focus on search engine optimization anymore. Quite frankly it's too much work for what I gain from it and I seem to be doing just fine without it. 

Why the shift? Well I started looking at where and how I find entertaining websites. The only one I found through a search engine in recent memory was <https://rogerhub.com> and even then it was through his [final grade calculator](https://rogerhub.com/final-grade-calculator/). Websites like [Nick Craver's](https://nickcraver.com/), [Paul Graham's](http://paulgraham.com/), [Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Tiffany Matth√©'s](https://www.tiffanymatthe.com/), among others, were all found organically from reading other websites or stumbling across them on Twitter.

I don't think I benefit from people finding my from search engines right now. My most clicked article on Google is [The Benefits of Wikipedia]({{< ref "benefits-wikipedia.md" >}}), which isn't exactly the type of content I want to write all the time. It also tends to spike towards the end of school terms, which hints at the type of visitor I'm getting. If new posts that I write happen to rank well, then great! I'm also not generating any direct income as a result of search visits. That's unlike blogs such as [Get Rich Slowly](https://www.getrichslowly.org) (as an example), that monetize their traffic and need visitors to sustain operations. That model isn't a bad one, I'm just not using it.

No longer am I going to aim for long posts or write things that will rank well just to please the SEO gods. I do think that longer posts are superior in general, so topics that are deserving will still get more extended writing. My focus will shift towards what I legitimately want to do, quality over quantity. I would rather write one or two well thought out and well edited pieces I actually care about each year than a smattering of those that I don't.
