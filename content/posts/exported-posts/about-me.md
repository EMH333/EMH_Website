Hey look! This is my about me page!

Ethan Hampton is a 16 year old male who lives in Oregon. He really
enjoys technology but also has fun with books and more physical things.
In addition, he love to hike but doesn't have time to do it as often as
he would like. Ethan has a great interest in programming and know many
languages (Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, etc). Also, he enjoys
gaming and working on visual projects such as films, animations,
photography and photo editing.

Ethan Hampton aspires to be some sort of a executive producer or
director for a show or movie after he owns a major tech company. He
enjoy the technical side of that sort of work. If Ethan had to pick, he
would not want to appear on camera at all. He would rather be the guy
that makes the people on camera look good... :) Eventually either being
a college professor or philanthropist. Ethan Hampton plans to go to
college to major in computer science and see where life takes him. He is
currently on his high school robotics team and is part of the
engineering pathway which he has found very beneficial. For now just
enjoy his website and the lack of content he has on it :) !
