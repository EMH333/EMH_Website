Sitting in math class this afternoon, I decided to try and figure out
where I spent my time. Was I spending too much time on my phone? Yes.
Was I spending too much time on homework? Yes. Or was I just plain doing
too much nothing? Yes. With my spectacular math skills, I calculated
that there are 168 hours in a week, and with some more simple math I was
easily able to figure out how much of that time I was doing something.

My Time
-------

Alright so lets take a look at where my time goes:

###     Consistent

- SAT Prep (6 hours per week(hpw))
- 4 hours for practice test
- 2 hours for actual class
- School (5 days a week, 8 hours = 40 hpw)
- Robotics (4.5 meetings per week, 2 hours per meeting = 9 hpw)
- Sleeping (everyday for 9 hours = 63 hpw)
- Note that I am including the time it takes for me to get up in
the morning and go to sleep at night
- Church (1.5 hpw)
- Piano Lesson (including travel time, 1.5 hpw)

###     Known

- Piano Practice (4 hpw)
- Time with Family (about 11 hpw)
- Including eating and other activities where I need to be focused
on family
- Phone (20 hpw)
- This is a rough estimation based on several apps on my phone, we
will get into that later
- This does not include time with other screens else this number
would be several hours higher
- Homework (about 9 hpw)
- These are all averaged per week
- Projects 3 (0.4 hpw)
- Digital Electronics (0.5 hpw)
- Math (3 hpw)
- Physics (2.5 hpw)
- APGOPO (1 hpw)
- Psych (0.25 hpw)
- ITCF (1 hpw)
- Plus other stuff as it comes up

So adding that all together we get about 165 hours. WOW, that is quite
close to the max of 168! And for most of those, that doesn't even
include travel time! Again it is worth nothing that this is definitely
not accurate in all regards, in particular in the "known" section
because that time isn't scheduled but rather loosely fit between
everything else.

Talking to some other people, I learned I was not alone. Perhaps I was
busy more that other people, but also consider that I am not doing a
sport. That adds quite a bit of time. Imagine two sports at once! As I
thought about it, I realized that this is a big problem for teenagers.
Time management is really a big deal because it can make or break how
someone's life plays out.
