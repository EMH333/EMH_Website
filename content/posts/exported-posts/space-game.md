HEY LOOK! A SPACE GAME!
=======================

This is a very simple space game, both WASD and the arrow keys work.
Mouse or Space bar shoots bullets. R to reload. Shift decreases
movement. You can drag the turret if you unlock it with your mouse. Hope
you have fun and enjoy! (side note, I forget if I updated this
correctly, have fun).
