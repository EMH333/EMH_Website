Flightgear?
-----------

Hey everyone on the internet! I figured I would start small and see what
to do with this thing. Coming soon, I will be starting a new series on
my channel (<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwNpWyYtQeV3WPJbeZFbkrQ>)
playing Flightgear because I don’t see a lot of new content for that
game. Eventually I may also get Rimworld and Kerbal Space Program but I
will start small for now. Updates will be inbound soon but Christmas is
coming and I am super busy (as we all are) around this time of year.

Want to learn how to fly?
-------------------------

You should check out my video if you want to learn how to get started
being an air traffic controller for flight gear (and I am sure you do).
It should give you a pretty good understanding for how to get started
with Flightgear as a whole as well. I probably will be doing a general
tutorial soon though.
