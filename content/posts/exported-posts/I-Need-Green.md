At this point in my life, I am trying to choose what colleges I want to
apply to. I know I want to major in computer science, I want a medium
sized school (between 10,000 and 30,000), I want a friendly environment
and I want to be close to a bigger city but far enough away that I don't
have to deal with traffic every day. Those are all pretty big on my
list, and there aren't a lot of schools that fit all of that criteria.
There is, however, one thing that is absolutely critical to the success
(in my opinion) of my college education. Somewhere that is green.

I Need Green
------------

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It is a pretty simple thing, but a true statement. All my life I have
grown up in the Pacific Northwest and have been surrounded by forest
trails, tall trees, rows and rows of grape vines and many other things
that are objectively green. Going away from that would be pretty hard,
visiting Mexico for a mission trip was incredibly difficult for me,
because I didn't have green to comfort my eyes. Trips to the Grand
Canyon, Arizona and other desert places don't feel right. I need green.

As an introvert, I dislike being outside, yet if I don't have the
ability to go outside, I feel terrible. Just a few minutes picking
tomatoes in the garden, raking leafs in the yard or hiking is enough let
me melt into that wonderful state where I can work hard but it is
mindless enough that I can let my mind wonder. Many people get this from
running or things like that, and I can too, but being in a green
environment is where I thrive.

Stay on the West "Coast"
------------------------

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All of this is leading to my conclusion that I need to stay on the west
coast. The west coast is green, has a fairly cool climate and is the
place I am familiar with. Anywhere but the west coast is out of the
question right?

Nope

No it's not, I was wrong. Lets look at this image that is probably 10's
of years out of date and inaccurate.

See. I was both wrong and right. There is green in other places, but you
don't know that till you look at a map.

How about climate?
