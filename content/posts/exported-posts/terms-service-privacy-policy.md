Like most website operators, Ethan Hampton collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
request. Ethan Hampton's purpose in collecting non-personally

visitors use its website. From time to time, Ethan Hampton may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Ethan Hampton also collects potentially personally-identifying

the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and
email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the
blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Ethan Hampton's websites choose to interact with
