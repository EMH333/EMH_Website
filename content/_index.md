I'm Ethan Hampton, a Computer Science major at Oregon State University. Currently, I have the privilege of working for the [Oregon State Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org), where I support a wide range of Open Source projects. In September, I'll be joining Jump Trading in Chicago as a TechOps Engineer. Alongside my professional engagements, I also work as a self-employed technology consultant.

With a diverse range of technology preferences, I strive for efficient solutions that scale effectively. My primary operating system is currently Pop!_OS, a Ubuntu derivative. I am constantly impressed by the flexibility and power of the Linux ecosystem. To explore more of my technology choices, visit [my infrastructure page]({{< ref "pages/infrastructure.md" >}}). Finding the right technology solution for each situation is my passion. I'm currently collaborating with individuals and businesses to address their ever-changing technology needs. Whether clients need assistance with development, system administration, or technology strategy, I provide tailored solutions to help them succeed.

When I am not working with technology, I find joy in the other meaningful activities in my life. I can often be found curled up with a good book, pondering some of the world's many problems, or exploring various mediums of writing. Outdoors, I like to hike, camp, bike and walk to take in the serene beauty nature has to offer. I also enjoy musicals, tinkering with electronics, spending quality time with friends, live music and playing piano. Studying abroad in Denmark in Fall 2022 accelerated my interest in urban infrastructure and how we craft our surroundings to provide culturally significant experiences. For a selection of my projects, you can check out on my [projects page]({{< ref "pages/projects.md" >}}) or [GitHub profile](https://github.com/EMH333).
