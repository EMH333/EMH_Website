My name is Ethan Hampton and I am a self-employed technology consultant (among other titles). I am currently attending Oregon State University Honors College, majoring in Computer Science. Additionally, I have the pleasure of working for the [Oregon State Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org), supporting a wide variety of Open Source projects.

My technology preferences are all over the place. For example, the range of languages I like to experiment with is JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Go, HTML(CSS, SCSS etc.), V, Python, C++, C# and so on. My main operating system is Pop_OS (a Ubuntu derivative) and I love having the flexibility the Linux environment provides. I take great pride in finding the right solution for every situation and I am currently working with several individuals and businesses to help meet their ever-changing technology needs.

If you think I could help you or your business, please contact me at: etho@ethohampton.com

If I am not working with technology, I enjoy reading, writing on my website, biking, running, tinkering, hanging with friends, playing piano and relaxing. I really like the challenges that robotics provides me and was a part of various FIRST FTC and FLL teams for over 9 years. In the 2018-2019 season with team 4711, we were selected to participate in the FIRST World Championships. My family also have websites, you can find my sister at [sophiahampton.com](https://sophiahampton.com) and my father at [procareering.com](http://www.procareering.com/). For a selection of my projects, you can check out on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/EMH333).

Thanks for finding my corner of the Internet!
