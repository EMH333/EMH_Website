My name is Ethan Hampton and I am currently in Chicago at Jump Trading LLC as a TechOps Intern (and that's all I can say about that). I attend Oregon State University Honors College, majoring in Computer Science. I have the pleasure of working for the [Oregon State Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org) during the school year, supporting a wide variety of Open Source projects. Additionally, I work as a self-employed technology consultant.

My technology preferences are very diverse, but I generally trend towards efficient solutions that scale well. My main operating system is Pop!_OS (a Ubuntu derivative) and I love having the flexibility the Linux environment provides. You can see more of my technology choices on [my infrastructure page]({{< ref "pages/infrastructure.md" >}}). I take great pride in finding the right solution for every situation and I am currently working with several individuals and businesses to help meet their ever-changing technology needs.

If you think I could help you or your business, please contact me at: etho@ethohampton.com

If I am not working with technology, I enjoy reading, writing on my website, biking, running, tinkering, hanging with friends, playing piano and relaxing. I currently work with ASOSU (student government at Oregon State University) as Vice-chair of the Judicial Council. I served as a Representative in the House for the 2021-2022 school year. For a selection of my projects, you can check out on my [projects page]({{< ref "pages/projects.md" >}}) or [GitHub profile](https://github.com/EMH333).

If you have any questions about anything I do, please feel free to contact me at: etho@ethohampton.com

Thanks for finding my corner of the Internet!
