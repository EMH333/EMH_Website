My name is Ethan Hampton and I am currently majoring in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I have the pleasure of working for the [Oregon State Open Source Lab](https://osuosl.org) during the school year, supporting a wide variety of Open Source projects. I'll be heading to Jump Trading LLC as a TechOps Engineer after I graduate. Additionally, I work as a self-employed technology consultant.

My technology preferences are very diverse, but I generally trend towards efficient solutions that scale well. My main operating system is Pop!_OS (a Ubuntu derivative) and I love having the flexibility the Linux environment provides. You can see more of my technology choices on [my infrastructure page]({{< ref "pages/infrastructure.md" >}}). I take great pride in finding the right solution for every situation and I am currently working with several individuals and businesses to help meet their ever-changing technology needs.

If you think I could help you or your business, please contact me at: etho@ethohampton.com

If I am not working with technology, I enjoy reading, writing on my website, biking, running, tinkering, hanging with friends, brainstorming ways to solve world problems, playing piano, and relaxing. Studying abroad in Denmark has accelerated my interest in urban infrastructure and how we craft our surroundings to provide culturally significant experiences. I currently work with ASOSU (student government at Oregon State University) as Vice-chair of the Judicial Council. I served as a Representative in the House for the 2021-2022 school year. For a selection of my projects, you can check out on my [projects page]({{< ref "pages/projects.md" >}}) or [GitHub profile](https://github.com/EMH333).

Thanks for finding my corner of the Internet!
