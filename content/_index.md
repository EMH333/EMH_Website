My name is Ethan Hampton and I am a self employed technology consultant. I am currently attending Oregon State University Honors College, majoring in Computer Science and working with several individuals and businesses to help meet their ever-changing technology needs.

## A little about me!

If I am not working with technology, I enjoy reading, writing on my website, biking, running, tinkering, hanging with friends and relaxing. I really like the challenges that robotics provides me and was a part of various FIRST FTC and FLL teams for over 9 years. In the 2018-2019 season with team 4711, I was able to go to the FIRST World Championships and learned a lot from that experience. I love my family who also has websites, where you can find my sister at [sophiahampton.com](https://sophiahampton.com) and my father [at procareering.com](http://www.procareering.com/). Also, I enjoy programming robots as well as small web toys and other projects. If you would like to know more about Ethan Hampton just ask, I would be happy to tell you! The blog section of my website has my musings and thoughts on a variety of topics as well as updates on my life. These posts are generally about topics that matter to me, so it would mean a lot if you took the time to check it out! My life as Ethan can be pretty crazy, and I find writing to be pretty soothing. My goal is to write at least one article a month. I sometimes publish some essays and other stories from my schooling if I think they meet my quality requirements. Ideally I will start posting a lot more technical writing here once I get into the swing of things. If you have any questions about anything I do, please feel free to contact me at: etho@ethohampton.com

Thanks for finding my corner of the Internet!
