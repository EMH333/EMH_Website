Why does this site look a little different right now? This is in solidarity with and for the Black Lives Matter movement which calls for change in the way we run our country. Good change that has been long overdue. Just changing some colors doesn't do much though, so note some links on the sidebar to resources and donation sites which can help keep this movement going.

My name is Ethan Hampton and I am a self employed technology consultant. I am currently attending Oregon State University Honors College, majoring in Computer Science and working with several individuals and businesses to help meet their ever-changing technology needs.

My technology preferences are all over the place. For example, the range of languages I like to experiment with is JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Go, HTML(CSS, SCSS etc.), V, Python, C++, C# and the list goes on. My main OS is Pop_OS (a Ubuntu derivative) and love having the flexibility the Linux environment provides. I take great pride in finding the right solution for the job.

If I am not working with technology, I enjoy reading, writing on my website, biking, running, tinkering, hanging with friends, playing piano and relaxing. I really like the challenges that robotics provides me and was a part of various FIRST FTC and FLL teams for over 9 years. In the 2018-2019 season with team 4711, we were selected to travel to the FIRST World Championships and I learned a lot from that experience. I love my family who also has websites, where you can find my sister at [sophiahampton.com](https://sophiahampton.com) and my father [at procareering.com](http://www.procareering.com/). Also, I enjoy programming robots as well as small web applications (such as [MACAB](https://abday.ethohampton.com/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=EthanHamptonHomePage)) and other projects which you can check out on my GitHub, [Ethan Hampton's GitHub Profile](https://github.com/EMH333).

This website/blog/thing on the Internet is a place for me to put stuff that I believe other people should see. A long time ago when I first was gifted the domain name, I put a whole bunch of stuff online that really had no place being there. I am now trying to be more purposeful with my content and also show some of the technical things I am working on. My blogging schedule is somewhat random but eventually I will get in the habit of producing more public content. I, as Ethan Hampton, (sorry, search engines like it when you repeat keywords in your text) also like to have a personal theory of everything that makes it easier for me and others to understand the way in which I approach the world. It is easier to think about something fully for a bit of time and then be able to refer back to it than to constantly think about it at "half power" and then get no where. Because of this, I have a page called ["Ethan's Rules of Life"]({{< ref "ethans-life-rules.md" >}}) that is fully version controlled and shows my thought process over time. It may be out of date sometimes but I do my best to update it as my world view changes.

Thanks for finding my corner of the Internet!
